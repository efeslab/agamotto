   NAME\n
      nvms_sleeping.c - NVM services for sleeping and waking up threads.

   DESCRIPTION\n
      The NVM library needs a mechanism similar to pthread condition variables 
      for blocking a thread when it needs to sleep until another thread releases
      a resource. Condition variables must be allocated in application global 
      memory so that they are available to all threads in an application.
