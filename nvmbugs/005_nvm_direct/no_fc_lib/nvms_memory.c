    NAME\n
      nvms_memory.c - NVM services for volatile memory management

    DESCRIPTION\n
      This implements volatile memory services for the NVM library.

    NOTES|
      Memory management services provide 2 classes of volatile memory based on
      the visibility to different threads of execution:

      1. Thread local memory is only accessed by a single thread of execution.
      It may be accessible to other threads, but the NVM library does not do
      that. If the owning thread exits the memory is automatically released
      by the services layer.

      2. Application global memory can be accessed by any thread via the same
      virtual address.

      For each class of memory, there is an allocate and a free service. Since
      the service library only supports a single process, this could be
      malloc/free for both classes.

      All volatile memory used by the NVM library is dynamically allocated from
      one of the two classes. The library does not declare any global or static
      variables other than those that are const. In order to maintain its
      state, it needs the services library to maintain root pointers. The NVM
      library allocates a root struct and stores a pointer to it in a root
      pointer. There are two kinds of root pointers :

      1. Application root pointer: There is only one application root pointer
      in an application. Every thread sees the same value. It is in application
      global memory.

      3. Thread root pointer: Each thread has its own private thread root
      pointer. It is in thread local memory so that it disappears if the thread
      calls nvm_fini.

   EXPORT FUNCTION(S)\n
      nvms_thread_set_ptr - set the thread local root pointer\n
      nvms_thread_get_ptr - get the thread local root pointer\n
      nvms_thread_alloc - allocate thread local memory\n
      nvms_thread_free - free thread local memory\n
      nvms_app_ptr_addr - get the application root pointer address\n
      nvms_app_set_ptr - set the application global root pointer\n
      nvms_app_alloc - allocate application global memory\n
      nvms_app_free - free application global memory\n
