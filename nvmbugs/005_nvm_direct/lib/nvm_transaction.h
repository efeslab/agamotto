    NAME\n
      nvm_transaction.h - Non-Volatile Memory atomic transactions

    DESCRIPTION\n
      This header defines the application interface for NVM transactions that
      atomically update multiple NVM locations.

    NOTES\n
      Unlike volatile memory, NVM retains its contents through a power failure 
      or processor reset. This can happen at any time. If it happens in the 
      middle of updating a data structure such as a doubly linked list, then a 
      mechanism is needed to restore the linked list to a consistent state. This
      problem can also arise when an application process throws an error or dies
      while manipulating persistent data structures.

      A transaction mechanism is needed to atomically modify an arbitrary set of
      locations in NVM. Before a transactional store to NVM, the old value of 
      the location will be saved in an NVM transaction data structure. This is 
      the undo to apply if the transaction aborts or partially rolls back. When
      all stores for the transaction are complete, the undo is deleted thus 
      committing the transaction. The application may choose to abort a 
      transaction applying all the undo generated so far. An application may 
      also create a savepoint and later apply all undo generated after the 
      savepoint was created. This is a partial rollback of the transaction.

      In addition to the above description of saving old values, we need the 
      ability to associate NVM locks with the transaction. A multi-threaded 
      application uses NVM locks to ensure only one thread at a time is 
      modifying an NVM data structure. Such a lock needs to be held until any 
      undo that modifies the data structure is either applied by rollback/abort 
      or discarded by transaction commit. Thus the lock is associated with the 
      transaction rather than the thread that acquired the lock. Since the 
      transactions survive process death the locks need to be in NVM just as
      the transaction data.

      When an application attaches to an NVM region, the region is checked to 
      see if there are any transactions that need recovery. Recovery is 
      completed before the attach function returns to the application. This 
      ensures the application only sees a consistent state in NVM after a 
      failure of the previous process to attach to the region. If recovery 
      cannot be completed due to some error, then the attach fails. Note that 
      this means a transaction can only modify one NVM region at a time because 
      recovery happens when the region is attached and regions are attached one 
      at a time. It is not possible to atomically modify data in two different 
      regions.

\par  On abort operations

      An application can create an operation to be executed if the active 
      transaction rolls back through the current point in the undo. This 
      creates an undo record with a pointer to a persistent application 
      function and a persistent struct to pass to the function. If the undo is 
      applied, the function is called in a new nested transaction. The nested 
      transaction is committed when the function returns.

      Creating an on abort operation returns a pointer to the struct in the 
      undo record so that arguments to the function can be modified later. It 
      is common to have a nested transaction do a transactional store into the 
      on abort operation so that it does nothing unless the nested transaction 
      commits. This can be used to implement logical undo to reverse the 
      effects of a nested transaction that committed.

      Note that the function must not signal any errors, exit the process, or 
      abort the nested transaction. This could result in an NVM region that 
      could never be attached since every time recovery is attempted it would 
      fail. Thus the only errors must be the result of serious NVM corruption.

      Note that the function could be called at recovery time so it must not 
      attempt to access any volatile data structures created by the process 
      that created the on abort operation.

\par  On commit operations

      An application can create an on commit operation using a mechanism that 
      is the same as creating an on abort operation except that the undo record
      does nothing if rolled back. All the on commit operations in a 
      transaction are executed after the transaction has committed and all its 
      locks released. While undo is applied in the reverse of the order it is 
      created in, on commit operations are executed in the same order as they 
      are created. Each on commit function is called in its own nested 
      transaction that is committed when it returns. 

      An on commit operation must not signal any errors, exit the process, or 
      abort the nested transaction. This would make it impossible to complete 
      the commit of a committed transaction. If an error is signaled or the 
      nested transaction aborts, the application process exits. Recovery will 
      first rollback the nested transaction then resume commit of the parent 
      transaction beginning with the on commit operation that failed. If it 
      fails again the region cannot be attached. 

      Note that the function could be called at recovery time so it must not 
      attempt to access any volatile data structures created by the process 
      that created the on commit operation.

\par  On unlock operations	

      An application can create an on unlock operation using a mechanism that
      is the same as creating an on abort or on commit operation except that
      the undo record is applied both when its transaction aborts or when it
      commits. When a transaction aborts all undo records including on unlock
      records are applied in reverse order. When a transaction commits all its
      locks are released in reverse order. An on unlock operation is treated
      like an nvm_mutex unlock record and applied while previously acquired
      locks are still held. Each on unlock function is called in its own nested
      transaction that is committed when it returns.
     
      An on unlock operation must not signal any errors, exit the process, or
      abort the nested transaction. This would make it impossible to complete
      the commit or abort of a transaction. If an error is signaled or the
      nested transaction aborts, the application process exits. Recovery will
      first rollback the nested transaction then resume commit or abort of the
      parent transaction beginning with the on unlock operation that failed.
      If it fails again the region cannot be attached.
      
      Note that the function could be called at recovery time so it must not
      attempt to access any volatile data structures created by the process
      that created the on commit operation.

\par  Nested transactions
      
      Nested transactions suspend operation of the current transaction so that 
      all transactional operations happen in the nested transaction. The nested
      transaction can commit or abort independently from its parent 
      transaction. When it commits its changes are persistent even if the 
      parent transaction aborts. The parent of a nested transaction can itself 
      be a nested transaction.

      Locks acquired by a nested transaction are released when the nested 
      transaction commits/aborts. This makes nested transactions useful for 
      avoiding deadlocks and for reducing the time a lock is held so that there
      is less contention. For example allocation from a heap is done in a 
      nested transaction. An on abort operation is created in the parent 
      transaction before the nested transaction is started. If the allocation 
      commits, but the parent transaction aborts, then the on abort operation 
      undoes the committed allocation.

      On commit operations created during a nested transaction are executed 
      when the nested transaction commits. The parent transaction does not 
      become the current transaction until all the on commit operations 
      complete and the nested transaction code block is exited.

\par  Explicit Commit/Abort
      
      The current transaction can be explicitly committed or aborted by calling 
      a library function. . The abort function returns when all undo has been 
      applied up to the beginning of the transaction. The commit function 
      returns when all on commit operations have completed. In either case all 
      locks acquired by the current transaction are released.
 
      Once a transaction is explicitly committed/aborted it is still the 
      current transaction, but it cannot be used for any more transactional 
      operations. Explicit commit/abort of a nested transaction does not make 
      the parent transaction current until the nested transaction is ended. A 
      transaction is defined by a specially annotated code block. The 
      transaction stays current until the code block is exited either by an 
      explicit transfer, executing  out the bottom of the block, or an NVM 
      longjmp to an NVM setjmp outside the code block.

      There is a library routine to report the current transaction nesting 
      level and the current transaction status. A current transaction can be 
      active, committed, or aborted. A nesting level of 0 means there is no 
      current transaction. A nesting level of 1 means the base transaction is 
      current.

     * This creates an undo record in the current transaction. The function
     * must be a persistent callback, meaning it has a pointer to a persistent
     * struct as its only argument. The record contains an instance of the
     * persistent struct. A pointer to the argument struct is returned so that
     * the caller can configure the arguments. The struct will be initialized
     * as if was allocated from an NVM heap.
     *
     * Note that the thread could die immediately after the undo record is
     * added to the transaction and before configuring the argument struct
     * is complete. Thus the callback must tolerate a partially constructed
     * argument. Unless there is a persist barrier, the stores into the
     * argument may complete in any order.
     * 
     * When the current transaction either commits or aborts, all the locks
     * acquired by the transaction are released in the reverse order they were
     * acquired. Similarly, rollback to a savepoint releases locks acquired
     * since the savepoint was established. For abort or rollback, all undo
     * records are applied in reverse order so that the locks are released
     * after all undo generated while the lock is held is applied.
     * 
     * The undo record created by this call is treated like a lock. The
     * indicated function is called with a pointer to the persistent struct
     * allocated in the undo record. The function is called at commit, abort,
     * or rollback that applies the record. When the callback is called, locks
     * that were held when nvm_onunlock() was called are still held. It is
     * called inside its own nested transaction. The callback function can
     * call nvm_txstatus(1) to determine if the parent transaction, containing
     * the unlock record, committed, aborted, or is being rolled back to a
     * savepoint.
     * 
     * The nested transaction is committed when the function returns. The
     * callback must not call nvm_abort because this would make the NVM region
     * unrecoverable. Note that during recovery the function may be called in
     * another process. If the thread executing the function dies, then
     * recovery will rollback the nested transaction and re-execute the
     * onunlock function.
     * 
     * This allows arbitrary application code to be called while locks
     * previously acquired are still held, even if the transaction is
     * committing. This is useful for executing code that only runs if the
     * transaction commits, and runs before relevant locks are released. This
     * mechanism can also be used to have application implemented locks that
     * are different than nvm_mutex locks. 
     * 
     * The callback function must not call longjmp to return to a setjmp that
     * was set before it was called. This would leave the transaction in a
     * partially committed state that is unlikely to be consistent. An assert
     * will fire if this is attempted.
     * 
     * If a new software release changes the callback function to take an
     * argument with a new field, then the old function should be kept with
     * the same USID and a new USID defined for the new version of the function.
     * The old version of the function may be registered under a new function
     * name as long as it has the same USID.  The old callback is only needed
