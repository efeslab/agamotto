   NAME\n
      nvm_heap.c - Non-Volatile Memory heap management

   DESCRIPTION\n
      This file implements NVM heap management including allocating/freeing
      NVM managed by the heap.

    NOTES\n
      When an NVM region is created the base extent is formatted as an NVM
      heap. The root struct is allocated from the heap in the base extent.
      Additional application data is allocated as needed. Additional heaps can
      be created and deleted as other region extents. Each heap can be given a
      name for administrative purposes.
