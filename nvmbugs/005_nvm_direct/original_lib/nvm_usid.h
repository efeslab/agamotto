    NAME\n
      nvm_usid.h - Non-Volatile Memory USID functions

    DESCRIPTION\n
      This header defines all the data structures and functions for associating
      USID's with global symbols in the executable and persistent struct types.

    NOTES\n
      USID stands for Unique Symbol IDentifier. It is a 128 bit true random
      number based on some physical phenomenon. These are defined in the source
      code by an attribute of the form
      USID("xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx")
      where the x characters are hex digits in 8 groups of 4 separated by
      white space. You can go to http://www.random.org/integers/?num=8&min=0&
      max=65535&col=8&base=16&format=html to 8 get truly random hex values of
      16 bits each separated by white space that you can paste into your code.

      About one time in 7300 the random number will not conform to the
      restrictions imposed on a USID. If this happens then you will get a
      compile error and must choose another random number. You can avoid most
      invalid USID values by not using a random number where one group of
      4 characters is "0000" or "ffff". If you do not see any bytes that start
      with 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, or f, then it will also be rejected.

      A USID is similar to a GUID or UUID, but has some differences. It does
      not conform to RFC4122 because all bits are randomly chosen. However
      about one in 7,300 random numbers are rejected. This ensures a USID is
      different depending on the bit field ordering and endianess of the
      platform. However, most values are rejected to reduce the chance of a
      USID matching application data. See nvm_usid_qualify for a more detailed
      description of the restrictions.

      Any symbol defined in an executable (i.e. nm will display it) can be
      associated with a USID that can be used as the symbol value in NVM. This
      is accomplished by preceding the declaration of the symbol with a USID
      attribute. Note that the value must never be changed once chosen, since
      that could make existing NVM regions corrupt.

      At run time a hash table is constructed to map the USID values to symbol
      values. Normally "&symbol" is an expression that evaluates to the
      symbol value. The USID of a symbol is represented by the expression
      "|symbol". It is a link time error if the symbol does not have a USID
      defined. A variable can be declared as a USID pointer by preceding the
      variable name with "|".  For example, "int |iptr;" would declare a
      pointer to an integer in volatile memory that is stored as a USID. The
      pointer is bound to a real address at run time by looking up the USID in
      the hash table. Each process may have a different value for the symbol
      since it might have a different executable.

      Since USID values are random numbers it is theoretically possible that
      there could be two values that are the same. This is detected when
      building the hash table at process startup. The process will exit if
      there are two attempts to register the same USID with different symbol
      values. Thus any conflict will be detected long before the code is
      debugged. In any case, the chances two independently chosen USID values
      being the same is vanishingly small. If you need a thousand USID's for
      your application, then the chance of any two being the same is much less
      likely than the earth being simultaneously hit by two independent
      extinction event asteroids in the same second on Friday Jan 13, 2113
      at 13:13:13 GMT. This is based on the presumption that such an asteroid
      hits the earth about once every 128 million years, or 2**52 seconds.
