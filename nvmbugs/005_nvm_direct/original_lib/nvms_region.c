   NAME\n
     nvms_region.c - NVM services for NVM region management

   DESCRIPTION\n
     These services are for managing region files that contain the NVM managed
     by the library. A region file can be sparse with multiple extents of NVM.
     On Linux this will be implemented by OS calls to an NVM file system.
