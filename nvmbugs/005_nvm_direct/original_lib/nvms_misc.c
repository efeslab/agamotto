   NAME\n
     nvm_misc.c - Miscellaneous NVM services

   DESCRIPTION\n
      This implements miscellaneous services for managing processor caching and
      dealing with errors.

      Processor caches can hold a dirty version of an NVM cache line. To make
      the contents of NVM consistent it is necessary to flush the caches to NVM.
      With flush on shutdown nothing is flushed until the system is shutting
      down. However flush on barrier requires the software to have barriers
      that ensure previous stores to NVM are persistent. The implementation of
      barriers is different from one platform to another. Thus there needs to
      be service functions to implement barriers.

      There are some error situations that cannot be handled by returning
      failure and setting errno. These are reported to the service library
      which exits the process so that recovery can be run.
