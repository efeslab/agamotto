   NAME\n
     nvm_locks.c - Management of transaction locks in non-volatile memory 

   DESCRIPTION\n
     This implements mutexes that are owned by NVM transactions and are kept
     in non-volatile memory so that they survive reboot.

   NOTES\n
     The NVM library introduces the concept of NMV locks for coordinating
     access to NVM data in the same region as the lock. NVM locks are similar
     to mutexes except that they are owned by a transaction rather than a
     thread of execution. They are released when the owning transaction
     commits, or if it rolls back all the undo generated after the lock was
     acquired. Rollback can be the result of an abort or rollback to savepoint.
    
     Since NVM locks are in NVM and associated with a transaction rather than
     a thread of execution, they survive process death and/or unmap of a
     region. When the region is reattached recovery will release all NVM locks
     as part of completing all transactions.
    
     To aid in deadlock avoidance, each NVM lock has a level associated with it.
     A lock cannot be acquired with waiting if a lock of the same or higher
     level is already owned by the transaction. It also has a sleep algorithm
     to indicate how long to spin before going to sleep when there is a lock
     conflict. There is a lock initialization call that must be made to set
     the level and sleep algorithm.
