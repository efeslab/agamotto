    NAME\n
      nvms_misc.h - NVM miscellaneous services

    DESCRIPTION\n
      This defines miscellaneous services for managing processor caching and
      dealing with errors.

      Processor caches can hold a dirty version of an NVM cache line. To make 
      the contents of NVM consistent it is necessary to flush the caches to NVM.
      With flush on shutdown nothing is flushed until the system is shutting 
      down. However flush on barrier requires the software to have barriers 
      that ensure previous stores to NVM are persistent. The implementation of 
      barriers is different from one platform to another. Thus there needs to 
      be service functions to implement barriers. 

      There are some error situations that cannot be handled by returning 
      failure and setting errno. These are reported to the service library 
      which exits the process so that recovery can be run.
